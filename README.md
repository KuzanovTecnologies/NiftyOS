# NiftyOS
Nifty OS is a hardstyle programmed recreation of a old lineage from Debian 12 Bullseye System - A Live System Architeture Project that came to life and my first linux distribution produced, but then i have abandoned the project and it will still continue to develop itself, A live system is independent, it can update, upgrade and fix/cleanse of its programming errors/bugs without my intervention, it does not need me.
